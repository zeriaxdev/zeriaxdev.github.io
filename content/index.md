# About

Terve! I'm **zeriax**, and you found my little internet corner! I really love
**[free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)** and programming.
I use **Arch Linux** as a daily-drive Linux distro but dualboot between it and Windows to run games (too lazy to modify shit).
Sometimes enjoy messing around with Discord's API and bots.
